# pihole-g
A repo for pihole gravity files and Windows hosts files to block unwanted traffic

This is an aggregate project to aggressively block:
<ul>
  <li>Adult sites</li>
  <li>Fake news</li>
  <li>Exploitative ads</li>
  <li>Click bait</li>
  <li>Junk social media links</li>
  <li>Includes an old Spybot S&D black list</li>
  <li>Much more</li>
</ul>

My inspiration is blocking the dark parts of the internet from my unsuspecting grandparents and parents using both PiHole and modifying the Windows hosts file on their desktops. This project will probably break a significant number of sites for the average user under 50yrs in 2021 - especially the host files.
